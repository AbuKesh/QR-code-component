## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned CSS Flexbox in this challenge. 

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.attribution {
  display: flex; 
  flex-direction: column;
  line-height: 1rem;
}

```

### Continued development

In this I have learned a lot about CSS Flexbox. At first it was hard to understand this concept of Flexbox, but as I go through it seems quiet easy.I am not still comfortable whit this technique but, I will continue to focus on this technique to make it perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me for placeing the container in the middle of the body. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the CSS Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
